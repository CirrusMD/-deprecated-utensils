# Sherpa todo list

## Styles and Markup
- Figure out the mobile layout (same as old sherpa?)
- Add a page heading

## Behaviors
- Figure out a difference between examples and usage - maybe dom
  elements are Usage Examples?
- Add usage not part of markup and todos to list of togglable items
- Store the current state of items via local storage

## Compiler
- Write the usage from the markup fields into each of the readmes, this
  is probably another tool
- Make markup cleaner?
- Get page level navigation in
- How to get outside links working correctly (i.e. github, site, project..)?
- Add pygments
- Read contents from code files (this is probably another tool similar
  to fixtures)
