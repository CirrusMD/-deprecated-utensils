# Utensils
Client side component library

## Todo

### Needed components
- finish pagination.sass
- Get rid of the opacity for close icons
- rework status stuff
- normalize padding?
- add remaining shadow and glow properties
- rename togglers
- popovers.sass *
- notifications.sass *
- progress-bars.sass *
- dropdowns.sass * (figure out how carets play into this)
- accordions.sass *
- tabs.sass *
- pills.sass *
- nav-lists.sass
- modals.sass *
- carousels.sass *
- navbars.sass *
- fishnet
- upgrades

### Reminders and Tasks
- Look at making the sass files use abstract elements
- Auto add the modifiers?
- Abstract status colors out to a variable to limit the output
- Anything that has a status color should get a builder?
- Add status classes to forms?
- Should we abstract focus/disabled states to a mixin?
- Test out the simple form integration
- Convert media queries
- Add view layout templates
- Turn into engine with generators
