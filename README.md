## Installation
Currently not yet released as a gem, so rock the latest from GitHub in
your `Gemfile`.

```
gem 'utensils', github: 'modeset/utensils'
```

Utensils is under continuous development. It's stable, but is subject to
change.


## Development
Use the interactive docs via [docomo](https://github.com/modeset/docomo)
at `/docs/live` for on the fly documentation generation.

View the tests through [teabag](https://github.com/modeset/teabag) at
`/teabag`, or run them from the CLI with:

```
rake teabag
```

Prior to committing, make sure to generate the latest static assets by
running:

```
rake utensils:document
```


## Todo
- Migrate remaining [modeset.js](https://github.com/modeset/modeset.js) files
- Mobilize (templates, styles, cs, etc..)
- See Todo items within each utensil
