# Todo

## WIP
- Carousels (finish)
- Carousel Touch
- Carousel Infinite
- Force classes to cleanup their own triggers
- Test dinosaurs css and js
- Media queries
- Listing of needed utensils
- Mobilize (templates, styles, js, etc..)
- Fishnet
- Complete Todo items

## Reminders, Tasks and Future Considerations
- There should be some sort of Toggle class that acts similar to the
  demo (removes a bunch of classes then add more) pass a data-remove?
- Should events have more of a namespace to avoid collisions?
- Need to figure out a way for the Directional tests to be more stable
  when there are other failures

## Repository
- FPO images (can't go public with the Burton photos)
- Turn into engine
- Add generators
- Better tools for documentation (generation, behavior, and styles)
- Better docs
- Use the style guide for dinosaur test
