## Reminders, Tasks and Future Considerations
- Lists should be able to pass a single element
- Look at making the sass files use abstract elements (placeholders)
- Align all focus states
- Should there be a selected state for all the coloring?
- Rename components subdirectory to utensils?
- Convert media queries
- Move the debug tools outside of this project
- Turn into engine with generators
- Really test out the order of sass files and where there are issues
- Look at all Todo items within each component
- Better tools for documentation (generation, behavior, and styles)
- Check for disabled states on components and disable interactions if
  true
- Should it be visually.shown/visually.hide? (how is this working on
  focus states?)
- standardize file naming structure

## Togglables
- Make Togglable lighter weight
- Is this overly complex for what we need it to be?
- Do tip and popover, drop extend Togglable instead of using composition?
- There should be some sort of Togglable class that acts similar to the
  demo (removes a bunch of classes then add more) pass a data-remove?
- Create wrappers around tab, pill, accordions etc. to minimize the
  required data-attributes 

## Vendor stuff
- Add a script for curling jQuery, underscore, respond.js and
  modernizr
