# Todo

## WIP
- Upgrades
- ARIA roles for templates/fixtures
- Style lists should be able to pass a single element
- Cleanup the lists within config (normalize and simplify)
- Manage focus states around all utensils
- Look at making the sass files use abstract elements (placeholders)
- Document mixins
- Scrub the behavior files and normalize
- Check for disabled states on components, disable interactions if true
- Cleanup Todo lists
- Media queries
- Carousels *
- Test Dinosaurs css and js
- Listing of needed utensils
- Fishnet

## Reminders, Tasks and Future Considerations
- Really test out the order of sass files and where there are issues
- Should it be visually.shown/visually.hide? (how is this working on
  focus states?)
- There should be some sort of Toggle class that acts similar to the
  demo (removes a bunch of classes then add more) pass a data-remove?
- Anyway to abstract ButtonGroup into ToggleGroup and kill this
  component?
- Should events have more of a namespace to avoid collisions?
- Try and lazy load more of the lookups and cache where possible
- Mobilize (templates, styles, js, etc..)

## Repository
- Standardize file naming structure
- Move the debug tools outside of this project
- Turn into engine with generators
- Better tools for documentation (generation, behavior, and styles)
- Better docs
- Add a script for curling vendor libraries (non-gems)
- Use the styleguide for dinosaur test
