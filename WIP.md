# Todo

## WIP
- notifications.sass
- navbars.sass *
- modals.sass *
- document mixins
- manage focus states around all utensils
- finish all utensil Todo lists
- view layout templates
- ARIA roles for templates/fixtures
- upgrades
- media queries
- dinosaurs style sheet
- carousels.sass *
- listing of needed utensils
- fishnet

## Reminders, Tasks and Future Considerations
- Style lists should be able to pass a single element
- Cleanup the lists within config (normalize and simplify)
- Look at making the sass files use abstract elements (placeholders)
- Really test out the order of sass files and where there are issues
- Should it be visually.shown/visually.hide? (how is this working on
  focus states?)
- Check for disabled states on components and disable interactions if
  true
- There should be some sort of Toggle class that acts similar to the
  demo (removes a bunch of classes then add more) pass a data-remove?
- Anyway to abstract ButtonGroup into ToggleGroup and kill this
  component?
- Should events have more of a namespace to avoid collisions?
- Try and lazy load more of the lookups and cache where possible

## Repository
- Standardize file naming structure
- Rename components subdirectory to utensils?
- Move the debug tools outside of this project
- Turn into engine with generators
- Better tools for documentation (generation, behavior, and styles)
- Add a script for curling vendor libraries (non-gems)
