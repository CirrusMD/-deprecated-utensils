# Todo

## WIP
- Scrub the behavior files and normalize
  - Collapse
  - Dismiss
  - Drop
  - Modal
  - Tab
  - Timeslot
  - Pop
  - Tip
- Check for disabled states on components, disable interactions if true
- Cleanup Todo lists
- Media queries
- Carousels *
- Test Dinosaurs css and js
- Listing of needed utensils
- Fishnet

## Reminders, Tasks and Future Considerations
- Really test out the order of sass files and where there are issues
- Should it be visually.shown/visually.hide? (how is this working on
  focus states?)
- There should be some sort of Toggle class that acts similar to the
  demo (removes a bunch of classes then add more) pass a data-remove?
- Should events have more of a namespace to avoid collisions?
- Try and lazy load more of the lookups and cache where possible
- Mobilize (templates, styles, js, etc..)

## Repository
- Standardize file naming structure
- Move the debug tools outside of this project
- Turn into engine with generators
- Better tools for documentation (generation, behavior, and styles)
- Better docs
- Use the style guide for dinosaur test
