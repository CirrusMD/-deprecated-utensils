# Todo

## WIP
- Try and lazy load more of the lookups and cache where possible
- Should it be visually.shown/visually.hide? (how is this working on
  focus states?)
- Find a better home for transition styles
- Really test out the order of sass files and where there are issues
- Media queries
- Carousels *
- Test Dinosaurs css and js
- Listing of needed utensils
- Mobilize (templates, styles, js, etc..)
- Fishnet
- Complete Todo items

## Reminders, Tasks and Future Considerations
- There should be some sort of Toggle class that acts similar to the
  demo (removes a bunch of classes then add more) pass a data-remove?
- Should events have more of a namespace to avoid collisions?
- Need to figure out a way for the Directional tests to be more stable
  when there are other failures

## Repository
- Turn into engine with generators
- FPO images (can't go public with the Burton photos)
- Better tools for documentation (generation, behavior, and styles)
- Better docs
- Use the style guide for dinosaur test
