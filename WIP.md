## Reminders, Tasks and Future Considerations
- Lists should be able to pass a single element
- Look at making the sass files use abstract elements (placeholders)
- There should be some sort of Togglable class that acts similar to the
  demo (removes a bunch of classes then add more) pass a data-remove?
- Should we abstract focus/disabled states to a mixin?
- Rename components to utensils?
- Convert media queries
- Move the debug tools outside of this project
- Turn into engine with generators
- Really test out the order of sass files and where there are issues
- Look at all Todo items within each component
- Better tools for documentation

## Bugs
- Weird bug on some of the button group clicking around deactivation

## Vendor stuff
- move jQuery out of the main files
- add underscore (maybe as a component)
- modernizer (as a component)
- add respond.js (as a component)
