# TODO

## WIP
- There should be some sort of Togglable class that acts similar to the
  demo (removes a bunch of classes then add more) pass a data-remove?

- tabs.sass *
- pills.sass *
- accordions.sass *
- nav-lists.sass
- dropdowns.sass * (figure out how carets play into this)
- modals.sass *
- notifications.sass *
- progress-bars.sass *
- carousels.sass *
- navbars.sass *
- fishnet
- upgrades
- debug tools
- turn the dimensionizer demo to togglable

## Reminders, Tasks and Future Considerations
- Lists should be able to pass a single element
- Look at making the sass files use abstract elements
- Should we abstract focus/disabled states to a mixin?
- Test out the simple form integration
- Look at https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari for pagination
- Convert media queries
- Add view layout templates
- Turn into engine with generators

## Bugs
- Weird bug on some of the button group testing around deactivation
- checkbox togglable groups and togglable targets should have the
  pointer when activated
