# Normalize
Normalize and reset base element styles to allow browsers to render all controls
more consistently and in line with modern standards.

Normalization and resets based on

- [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/)
- [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)

## Usage

This should appear right after library and mixin loads, but before any
specific styles are imported. This module operates on top level elements
and inserts them directly into your style sheet.

```sass
@import roos/components/normalize
```
