# Utensils Specs

All of the `_spec` files live within the utensil's directory alongside
their behavior, style and markup (fixture) files.

Mocha is setup under [teabag](https://github.com/modeset/teabag) with
[expect.js](https://github.com/LearnBoost/expect.js/) and [sinon.js](http://sinonjs.org/).

## Running
Run the spec's at `/teabag` or from the command line with `rake teabag`
